# BDD_Mockito

 BDD is a good way of organizing your tests you structure using Given, When and Then
 
 Given - Preconditions and set up
 When - when the actual method is called which we want 
 to test(SUT Method call)
 Then - we have to check all the asserts
 
 Given, Whem and Then is a good way of writing your
 tests and what mockito come up with specific class
 its BDD mockito where they are specific methods 
 which would help you to write tests in that way
 instead of when and thenReturns we can use given
 and will return
 
 when --- given
 
 thenReturn - willReturn 
 
 they are few Specific methods
 assertEquals - assertThat
 assertThat(actual, is(2)) - is(value) - Hamcrest Matcher
 willThrow - the method will throw an exception
